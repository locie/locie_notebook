    "# <center> Using DEAP to do multiobjective optimization with NSGA2</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "1st release of this notebook, still in progress though. If you have any suggestion to improve it, please let me know or PR it  on github !\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "At LOCIE Lab, the project RÃ©ha-Parcs aims to apply multi-objective optimization on building stock. Bibliography tended to pick Genetic Algorithm to optimize.\n",
    "In the field of building physics, the algorithm NSGA2 is widely used because it is know as stable and results are good in term of convergence and diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good implementation of NSGA2 is available in the library DEAP. This library makes possible to do complex many objective optimization and to use a lot of different algorithm pretty easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this notebook is to provide PhD student at LOCIE with a cheatsheet to launch quickly an optimization with this algorithm with some explanation on the code. It is freely based on the example provided by the developpers of DEAP for the algorithm NSGA2 since their code is pretty short and efficient. I tried to provide more explanations and my small experience on this example here. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some prior knowledge about how NSGA-II is working is needed as this notebook is focusing on its implementation."
