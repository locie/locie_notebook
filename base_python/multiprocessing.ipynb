    "Threads are sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by the os. They share the memory space (so we have to be carefull and ensure thread safety, in order to avoid two threads writing in the same emplacement at the same time), and they are the common way to deal with asynchrone computation and to improve performance when the machine has more than one CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Processes are instance of a computer program that is executed. They do not share memory and require special object to share information, objects as queue, shared objects, pipes, semaphores... They are heavier than the threads, but are safer due to the lack of common memory space."

    "## Multiprocessing / threading in python\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the [GIL (Global interpreter lock)](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock),   multiple threads cannot execute Python bytecodes at once. It reduced the usefullness of threading : only the function that release the GIL can run at the same time. It's the case for I/O operations (web protocol requests as http/ftp, on-disk reading / writing), and for most numpy operations that rely on C routines.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's why, in the Python ecosystem, multiprocessing is prefered over threading. NB: some trial has been made to take the GIL away from CPython, and led to drastic performance regression ([more info](http://python-notes.curiousefficiency.org/en/latest/python3/multicore_python.html)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a nice standard library that allow multiprocessing computation. It's called [`multiprocessing`]. Good to know: the library [`threading`] is for multiple threads computation and has a very similar API, even if the tendancy is to use [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) based library to deal with I/O operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some libraries allow abstraction that help multiprocessing computation, as joblib (part of the sklearn ecosystem), [`concurrent.futures`] (in the stdlib, allow future-based API), [`distributed`] (part of the dask ecosystem and allow local and distributed computation that can live on other computers) and so on... I will focus on the stdlib [`multiprocessing`] first, then have few words on the other tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "NB: a nice tool called [`joblib`] can be used to provide an unified way to do embarassingly parallel computation. I will also have a word on this tool at the end.\n",
